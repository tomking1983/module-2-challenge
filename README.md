# 02 Working with CSS Challenge: Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

### User Story

AS A web developer
I WANT a portfolio that showcases my skills as I learn
SO THAT I can use this portfolio in future work opportunities
```
